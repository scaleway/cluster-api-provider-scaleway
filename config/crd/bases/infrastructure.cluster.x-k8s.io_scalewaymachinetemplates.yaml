                  - "Degraded": the resource failed to reach or maintain its desired state

                  The status of each condition is one of True, False, or Unknown.

                  conditions represent the current state of the ScalewayMachineTemplate resource.
                  Each condition has a unique type and reflects the status of a specific aspect of the resource.

                  Standard condition types include:
                  - "Available": the resource is fully functional
                  - "Progressing": the resource is being created or updated
                  - "Degraded": the resource failed to reach or maintain its desired state

                  The status of each condition is one of True, False, or Unknown.
                items:

                        lastTransitionTime is the last time the condition transitioned from one status to another.
                        This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.
